# This is a repo I made in collaboration with Public Source, a news source local to Pittsburgh that provides citizens
with "in-depth reporting and data on the environment, health, criminal justice and money and politics."

Fully responsive, I designed the style, layout, and coded the functionality. Slight style tweaks were made before article
was publicized.
